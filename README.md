## Custom Object Detection for Pipes using YOLOv5
Welcome to our custom object detection project for pipes using YOLOv5! This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for detecting pipes within images, leveraging the powerful capabilities of the YOLOv5 model. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or enthusiast, our project aims to facilitate accurate and efficient pipe detection for various applications.

## YOLOv5 Overview
YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection tasks. It stands for "You Only Look Once," emphasizing its ability to detect objects in images in real-time with remarkable accuracy. YOLOv5 achieves this by dividing the input image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. With its streamlined architecture and efficient inference, YOLOv5 is well-suited for a wide range of object detection applications, including our custom pipe detection task.

## Additional Resources

In addition to the source code and documentation, we have included the following resources to assist you:

- **best.pt Weights**: We provide the `best.pt` weights file for the trained YOLOv5 model. These weights represent the optimal parameters learned during the training process and can be used for inference on pipe detection tasks.

- **COCO YAML**: We include the COCO YAML file, which contains the configuration settings used for training the YOLOv5 model. You can use this YAML file to reproduce our training setup or customize the model architecture for your specific requirements.

- **Dataset**: We obtained our dataset from-https://universe.roboflow.com/yolov5-0f27k/yolo-v5-pipe-field

Feel free to utilize these resources in your experiments, applications, or further development efforts. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation or reach out to us for assistance.

## Training Metrics
During the training process, various metrics are tracked to assess the model's performance and convergence. These metrics include loss values, precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). We provide detailed training metrics and visualization tools to analyze the training progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix is a valuable tool for evaluating the model's classification performance. It provides insights into the model's ability to correctly classify pipes and distinguish them from other objects or background elements. We generate and analyze the confusion matrix to assess the model's accuracy and identify any patterns or misclassifications.
